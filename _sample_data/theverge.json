The company specializes in using deep-learning techniques to analyze and classify images on smartphone-level processors.

The reason? It doesn't support teletype services (TTY) for the deaf and hard of hearing very well, which the FCC generally requires of wireless networks. In its place, AT&T wants to deploy real-time text (RTT), which it says is faster, richer, and generally better than TTY — a decades-old technology.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/6/9466279/att-wi-fi-calling-fcc-waiver\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n</p>\n"
